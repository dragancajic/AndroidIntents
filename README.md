# Android Intents
#### _Android Intents are how apps communicate with the operating system and with each other._

They are the “glue” between activities. _Using intents_, you can adjust your app's user experience or<br />
ask other apps to perform common actions: taking photos, sending emails and SMS messages, and<br />
even displaying locations on maps and playing media.
